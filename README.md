Fun with Node
===========

Basic nodeJS website with a websocked-based captcha alternative.
Updated 2/2013. 

You are validated by changing the Are you human? text box from "I am not" to "I am". On validation, the socked is established and the sensitive (contact/personal) information is delivered. This is in the server code and never otherwise on the web. Of course, that information is now in the source on github. In the next version I will include basic obfuscation to protect the github source from web crawlers.
